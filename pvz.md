We have seen puckk do this as well and he added immortals behind the phoenix along with storm.

- Pylon (*create wall at expo*)
- Assimilator
- Gateway
- Cybernetics Core
- Assimilator
- Pylon (*at expo wall*)
- Gateway 
    - To complete wall, right before zerglings could come
    - If your scout is suspecting a 12 pool, keep your probe by the wall to do a puckk style wall fill
- Nexus
- Stargate
- To be continued

## Zerg Opens w/o Gas

Another Rotti inspired build (he did this vs. Katz on NA ladder 6/11/2018) on Darkness Sanctuary
***
This build takes advantage of a lack of early metabolic boost and leverages un-upgraded gateway units.
  
You should have just enough vespene for warp gate research and 2 early adepts, the rest of the resources go towards this 7-gate 2-base all-in. Cap probe production at ~35 workers.

- Pylon
- Assimilator (*only send 2 probes*)
- Gateway (*start a wall*)
- Nexus
- Cybernetics Core
- Pylon (*proxy outside zerg base w/shield battery*)
- Gateway (*proxy*)
- Warp Gate
- Adept x2 (*send to enemy base for harass*)
- Gateway x5 (*add one more probe to vespene*)
- (*cut probes at ~35, start warping zealot/stalker/adept at proxy*)

If the proxy is going to be attacked, you will likely have to make an early call whether or not to defend it.
The attack should hit between 4:15 and 4:30 if done well.
  
  
If all goes well and depending on how the attack is going, you may add probes to vespene and try to transition with tech.
Also remember this build hinges on the fact that the zerg doesn't have metabolic boost. AKA he can't quickly run to your base, kill you with speedlings, and you will likely have the first opportunity to be aggressive.


# Scouting Timings
- If you aren't getting ~12 pooled, you should see a hatchery at ~1:00.
- If you see 2 expansions before 2 mins that is greedy
