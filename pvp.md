## The Juice
- Double gateway (Two adept)
    - These two adepts can be used to phase behind the opponent's mineral line and kill as many workers as possible (make sure to focus the workers, especially don't take on stalkers or even other adepts).
          - If the initial adepts are successful make some more ;)
- Starport (Phoenix)
    - Counters the imminent oracle
        - Creates arms race for phoenix (unless opponent gets enough stalkers/cannons)
        - If this gets out of hand you may want the range upgrade from Fleet Beacon to kite
        - Shield Batteries by mineral lines will help with counter attacks, but usually I only feel safe when I have 2-3 cannons at each mineral line :|
        - If the phoenix cause the opponent to go stalkers, follow up with a robo. You can continue phoenix production too, as they can be used to lift their immortals.
