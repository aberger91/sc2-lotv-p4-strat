# Strategy for Starcraft 2 LOTV Patch 4.x
For now each file will be a certain race or match-up i.e.:
- p.md
- pvz.md
- pvt.md
- pvp.md

# Commonly used aliases
If you play starcraft most of these should be well understood, but we like making up words too:
- robo: Robotics Facility
- to 'go robo': make at least 2 Robotics Facilities
- gate: Gateway/Warpgate
- cannon: Photon Cannon
